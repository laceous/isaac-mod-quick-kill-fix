    <description>Quick kill (debug 10) is useful when testing mods. Unfortunately, this option causes issues with a few bosses. This mod fixes those issues.

[list]
    [*]The Lamb: The Lamb's body won't keep spamming the poof animation
    [*]Delirium: Delirium will actually die rather than getting stuck in a loop
    [*]Rotgut: Rotgut's first phase won't get stuck anymore, and you can proceed to the next phase
    [*]Mother: Mother won't die immediately, Mother2 will spawn, and you won't be softlocked
    [*]Dogma: Dogma won't die immediately, you won't be softlocked, and you'll be taken to The Beast
